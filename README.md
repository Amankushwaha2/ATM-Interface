# ATM Interface

The ATM Interface is a Java-based application that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) interface. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the ATM and perform various banking operations. This README file provides an overview of the application and explains how to set it up and use it.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can authenticate themselves by providing their account number and PIN. This ensures that only authorized users can access the ATM functionalities.

- **Balance Inquiry**: Users can check their account balance to view the available funds in their account.

- **Cash Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw cash from their account by specifying the desired amount. The ATM verifies the availability of funds and dispenses the requested amount if available.

- **Deposit**: Users can deposit cash into their account by inserting the money into the ATM. The ATM validates the currency and updates the account balance accordingly.

- **Transfer**: Users can transfer funds from their account to another account within the same banking system. They need to provide the recipient's account number and specify the transfer amount.

## Setup

To set up and run the ATM Interface, follow these steps:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine if not already installed. Make sure to use a compatible version of Java for the system.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.

3. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

4. Build the project to resolve any dependencies and compile the Java classes.

5. Run the application from your IDE or use the command line to execute the generated JAR file.

6. The ATM interface will be displayed on the console or a graphical user interface (GUI) based on the implementation.

## Usage

Once the ATM Interface is running, users can interact with the application using the provided options:

1. Authenticate themselves by entering their account number and PIN.

2. Select the desired operation from the available options, such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, or transfer.

3. Follow the prompts to provide the required information for the selected operation, such as the withdrawal amount or transfer details.

4. Receive confirmation messages or transaction receipts for the completed operations.

5. Logout or end the session when finished.
